            <p>
                Cellular Force-Inference-Toolkit (CellFIT) is a package of force inference equations and assessment
                tools that calculates the forces in cell edges based on their geometries. In this approach, cells in an
                image are segmented and equilibrium equations are constructed for each triple junction based solely on
                edge tensions and the angles at which edges approach each junction. Solving the resulting system of
                tension equations yields a set of relative edge tensions whose scaling must be determined from data
                external to the image. In this implementation, the goal is to optimize the user interface for improved
                accessibility of CellFIT to scientists of all backgrounds across all platforms (Linux, MacOS, Windows).
                Applying this tool to the cell mechanics of wound healing is of particular interest.

                Given an image of an epithelial cell sheet, CellFIT can infer cellular forces by segmenting the image
                into individual cells, constructing equilibrium equations for the points where cells meet at triple
                junctions, and finding a least-squares solution for the tensions at cell­cell interfaces. Similarly,
                cellular pressures can be estimated by constructing Laplace equations that relate the edge tensions,
                curvatures and cellular pressure differences. Despite these capabilities, the accessibility of CellFIT
                to scientists of all backgrounds is not yet optimized. I am working on an updated web­based application
                of CellFIT that allows users to access the software from a browser. The updated version would include
                improved error handling and the implementation of additional functionality for reading and processing
                image stacks. I hope to apply the web-based CellFIT to time-resolved image stacks of wound healing in
                Drosophila epithelia to demonstrate spatial and
                temporal variations in cellular forces as the wounds close.
